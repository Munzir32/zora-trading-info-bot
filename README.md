   ```

### Option 3: Docker Deployment

1. **Create a Dockerfile**:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM node:16-alpine
   
   WORKDIR /app
   
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm install
   
   COPY . .
   RUN npm run build
   
   CMD ["node", "dist/bot.js"]
   ```

2. **Build and run with Docker**:
   ```bash
   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t zora-trading-bot .
   
   # Run the container
   docker run -d --name zora-bot --env-file .env zora-trading-bot
   ```

3. **Deploy to container platforms**:

## üéØ The Problem It Solves

The Zora AI Trading Assistant addresses several key challenges in the NFT trading space:

- **Information Overload**: NFT traders often struggle to process vast amounts of market data to make informed decisions. Our bot aggregates and analyzes this data to provide clear, actionable insights.

- **Risk Management**: Many traders lack proper risk management strategies. Our bot provides comprehensive risk assessment and specific stop-loss/take-profit levels.

- **Market Timing**: Determining the optimal entry and exit points is crucial. Our AI-powered analysis helps identify these opportunities.

- **Portfolio Tracking**: Managing multiple NFT holdings across different collections can be complex. Our bot centralizes this information in one place.

- **Technical Barriers**: The Zora Protocol ecosystem can be intimidating for newcomers. Our bot simplifies interaction with the protocol through an intuitive Telegram interface.

## üß© Challenges We Ran Into

During development, we encountered several significant challenges:

- **SDK Integration**: The Zora Protocol SDK had some type compatibility issues with the Viem library, requiring careful type casting and parameter handling.

- **BigInt Serialization**: JSON serialization of BigInt values from blockchain data required special handling to ensure proper conversion to strings.

- **Real-time Data**: Ensuring accurate real-time price data from the Zora network required implementing robust error handling and fallback mechanisms.

- **AI Analysis Quality**: Balancing the depth of AI analysis with response time was challenging. We optimized the prompts to provide valuable insights while maintaining quick response times.

- **User Experience**: Creating a seamless experience within Telegram's message constraints required careful formatting of complex trading data into readable messages.

## üõ†Ô∏è How We Built It

The Zora AI Trading Assistant was built through a systematic approach:

1. **Architecture Design**: We designed a modular architecture with separate services for Zora Protocol interaction, AI analysis, and Telegram bot functionality.

2. **Zora Integration**: We implemented the Zora Service to interact with the Zora Protocol SDK, handling token data retrieval, price tracking, and market analysis.

3. **AI Analysis Engine**: We developed an AI Service that leverages OpenAI's GPT models to provide intelligent market analysis and trading recommendations.

4. **Telegram Bot Interface**: We created a user-friendly Telegram bot interface with intuitive commands and well-formatted responses.

5. **Trading Analysis Logic**: We implemented comprehensive trading analysis algorithms that process market data to generate entry/exit points, risk assessments, and recommendations.

6. **Testing & Refinement**: We continuously tested the bot with real Zora tokens and refined the analysis algorithms based on performance.
